ofthis book are all reproduced from colour photographs taken directly fromnature The plants were all photographed exactly as they were foundwith two exceptions in the immediate neighbourhood of Rosenlaui in theBernese Oberland during the month of July 1909 so that the pictures aretrue portraits of the flowers at homeThe Lumire process of colour photography which was used depends on theaction of light on a photographic plate after its passage through variouscoloured starch grains The process is entirely beyond the control ofthe operator and the exact colours are automatically reproduced Thesephotographs have in turn been carefully reproduced for this work by thethree colour processThe flowers here photographed were selected as good examples of commonand typical species and of course they represent but a very smallportion of the rich flora of Switzerland The present volume is intendedas a short introduction to the subject for the fuller study of which thefollowing works are recommended    A Gremli The Flora of Switzerland Translated by Paitson    A W Bennett The Flora of the Alps    G Hoffmann Alpine Flora Translated by E S Barton    L and C Schrter Coloured Vademecum to

have all been freely referred to in the preparation of theaccompanying notesWherever possible the common name of each plant in English French andGerman has been given on the corresponding plate It is hoped that thismay be of use to the readerIn conclusion I would like to thank the publishers for the great troublethey have taken in the preparation of the plates and Mr Howard Farmerof the

                   78IntroductionNo one can visit Switzerland for the first time without being struckwith the singular beauty of its wild flowers In the early summer thewhole country from the lowland meadows right up to the snowline is ablazewith beauty Probably in no other part of the world are the forms ofthe flowers more pleasing and their colours more brilliant Hence it isthat almost everyone who visits the Alps however little interest he maytake in the wild flowers of his own home desires to know something ofthe wonderful new forms that everywhere meet his gaze Here the charmof novelty also comes in for at least half the flowers met with in theAlps are absent from the plains and many of the species that occur inboth situations have as we shall see later acquired such differentcharacters at high altitudes as to be with difficulty at first sightrecognised Those who would see Switzerland in all its beauty and asfar as its floral treasures are concerned at its best must visit it inearly June before the hay is cut Otherwise they will miss the glory ofthe unmown meadows and although many of the spring flowers like theCrocuses and Primulas Plate 35 may still be found in small quantitiesat high altitudes even in July the striking effect of the large massesof these flowers will be entirely wantingIf we travel to Switzerland by the ordinary tourist route across Germanyor France and then ascend the mountain peaks we shall in the firstpart of our journey notice but few differences in the vegetation fromthat to which we are accustomed The wild flowers of France and Germanyare very like those of the South of England and except that perhaps theyellow Fullers Thistle Circium oloraceum may be seen in damp placesnear the railway very little of botanical interest will be observeduntil the customs are passed and Switzerland itself is reached Evenhere the traveller may be for a time a little disappointed The firstunfamiliar plant to be noticed will very likely be the Redberried ElderSambucus racemosa A little later in some shady wood the tallfeathery Spira Spira Aruncus or the beautiful little MayLilyMaianthemum bifolium may be seen Or a glimpse of the whitefloweredRampion Phyteuma spicatum or the Alpine Honeysuckle Loniceraalpigena with its twin red berries may be had in passing But notuntil the mountains themselves are reached will the tourist discover thathe has entered into an entirely new plant worldThe main factor which determines the character of the flora of any givenregion in the Alps is its altitude But we must not forget that there areother things to be considered beside the absolute height above the sealevel and the local conditions of exposure to the sun and protectionfrom the cold winds are quite important factors Generally speakingit may be said that the climate is a good deal milder on the southernslopes of the Alps than in the north Olives can be grown in some ofthe lower mountain regions of the south and with them are found manyof the plants of Southern Europe and the Mediterranean region which arenever seen in places of the same altitude on the northern slopes Itis exceedingly probable that most of the lower parts of the Alps wereoriginally covered to a large extent by forest trees The oak ash andbeech still flourish in many parts although much of the original foresthas been removed long ago and used for building purposes or as fueland large areas have been thus cleared for meadow and pasture land Inmany districts the spruce and the pine appear to be usurping the place ofthe other forest trees mainly because the young plants are less eagerlydevoured by browsing animals especially the goats Below 4000 feet onthe northern slopes and 5000 feet or a little over on the south side ofthe Alps may be described as the REGION OF FOREST TREES and above thislevel the ordinary deciduous trees become dwarfed and scarce That thisaltitude corresponds fairly well with a transition to a colder climateis seen by the change in the character of the herbaceous plants alsoFor the next 2000 feet we have the SUBALPINE REGION covered mainly byConiferous trees Here are vast forests particularly of Spruce Piceaexcelsa and Silver Fir Abies pectinata The former is the familiarChristmas tree which grows to a great height on the mountain sidesits lower branches festooned with grey lichens Besides these trees theLarch Larix Europa on primary rock and the Scotch Fir Pinussylvestris and the Arolla Pinus Cembra are also to be seenAbove 6000 feet in the north and 7000 in the south the Conifers becomedwarfed and stunted and gradually disappear to give place to the ALPINEREGION Sometimes as we look along a valley the line of transition isseen to be abrupt and straight at other times irregular and undulatingBushes of Alpenrose Juniper and Alpine Willow extend upward to theAlpine region but larger trees are entirely absent Here are found inprofusion the greater number of the plants and flowers peculiar to theAlps Many of the species may of course be found in sheltered or secludedspots at much lower levels but here are to be seen in abundance thebrightcoloured Saxifrages Gentians Anemones and Pansies which makethe Alps their particular home Here are the alps or upland pasturegrounds of the Swiss and here are situated the chlets or summer homesof Swiss herdsmen In June or July when the pasture is becoming scarcein the valleys and when all the snow is melted on the mountain slopesthe native farmer packs a large copper caldron and whatever else he mayrequire for making cheese into his bullock waggon and accompanied by hiscattle and often by his family as well treks upward The alps may betwo or three days journey from his home so that he must take with himall that he will probably require for his two or three months stayThe Alpine region extends from the upper tree limit to the snowlinewhich may be taken as somewhere between 8000 and 9000 feet Some of themost charming and brightly coloured of Alpine plants like Eritrichiumnanum and the Cushion pinks Plate 9 are to be found just below thesnowline Even above this level flowering plants may be met with foreven at the highest altitudes bare rock is to be found from which thesnow has been blown by the wind or melted by the sun or where the slopeis too great for more than a very thin covering to remain lodged TheGlacier Crowfoot Ranunculus glacialis a pinkflowered buttercuphas for example been found within a short distance of the summit of theFinsteraarhorn the highest peak in the Bernese OberlandJust over two thousand different species of flowering plants are to befound in Switzerland and a little over half of these are exclusivelyAlpine In contrasting the flowers of the Alps with those of our owncountry it may be first of all well to consider what we have thatSwitzerland has not Of course our seashore plants will be mainly absentbut strange to say a few species of Thrift are here and there foundand the yellow Horned Seapoppy Glaucium luteum even grows in theneighbourhood of Lake Neuchtel We are so used to the bluebells of ourwoods the purple heather of our heaths and the yellow gorse of ourcommons that we hardly realise how glorious they are In Switzerlandthe gorse is very rare the bluebells are not found at all and thebellheathers are absent though the ling is found everywhere Even thepurple foxglove is replaced by a yellow variety These facts should beborne in mind lest a too unfavourable comparison be made with our ownrich floraBut the flowers of the mountains are truly wonderful and it is theirabundance as well as their bright colours that make them so strikingAt the same time it must be remembered that though so numerous neitherthe flowers themselves nor the plants that bear them are reallylarger than their lowland relatives Indeed in spite of their brightconspicuous flowers the plants that grow at the higher altitudes aregenerally stunted and dwarfed Most of the peculiarities of Alpineplants which we will now enumerate are to be accounted for by theconditions under which they live That this is really so is shown by thefact that within the bounds of what must unquestionably be regardedas a single species individuals change in character as we ascend tohigher altitudes the leaves become more hairy and more fleshy and theflowers brighter and larger Even more direct evidence of this is tobe obtained by cultivating Alpine plants at lower levels and lowlandplants at high altitudes Not a few of the plants of the mountains whengrown in our gardens at home change in character very considerablyThey tend to elongate so that their leaves are separated by longerintervals of stem and their hairy characters very largely disappearThe Bearded Bellflower Plate 26 may lose its bearded characterand the familiar Edelweiss may in some cases develop smooth greenleaves almost as hairless as those of an ordinary plant Conversely wehave the observations of Professor Bonnier who cultivated the plantsof the lowlands at high altitudes in the Alps and Pyrenees Where theplants were able to grow at all they became in most cases stunted anddwarfed The Jerusalem Artichoke for example which forms a tall leafystem like a sunflower in the plains became a short stumpy plant withleaves arranged in a rosette at its base Generally speaking the plantsdeveloped a better marked underground stem and thicker darker greenleaves than the same species grown under more ordinary conditionsOne of the principal characteristics of Alpine plants is the extensivedevelopment of the rootstock and underground stem This is required toprotect them against the strong winds and to extract as large a supplyof water and nourishment as possible from the frequently scanty soil Butthere is another consideration of at any rate equal importance During atleast half of the year owing to the white coverlet of snow all activityin the Alpine plant world ceases so that the production of flowers andseeds indeed all the vital processes of the plants must be crowded intothe few months when the ground is clear Crocuses and Snowbells andother plants are found blooming at the very edge of the snow thereforeeverything must be ready for immediate flower production directly thesnow melts For this to take place a reserve store of nourishmentis essential and accordingly Alpine plants are furnished with thickunderground stems and fleshy roots where the food substances can bestoredIt is further interesting to note that the number of plants that gothrough their life cycle in a single year and then die off annuals asthey are called is in the Alps comparatively small for most of theplants persist from year to year Kerner states that while only 44 percent of the plants on the Danube plains are perennials there are asmany as 96 per cent in the Alps That this has something to do withthe conditions under which the plants grow is seen by the fact that theannual meadowgrass Poa annua becomes perennial in the Alps Annualspersist through the winter season only in the form of seed so thata single wet summer such as the last 1909 by interfering with theripening of the seeds might threaten with extinction an entire speciesAnnuals have but little food stored up for a sudden outburst of activityon the approach of spring nor can the tiny root of a budding seedlingobtain from the soil all that is necessary for the rapid production offlowers and seeds Moreover as we shall see immediately the productionof seeds is in most plants very largely dependent on the presence ofinsect visitors and without them either less fertile seeds or no seedsat all are in most cases formed Insects are said to be less numerousin the Alps than in the plains and thus the assumption of a perennialcharacter makes the existence of the plant less dependent on externalconditionsAnother point which has already been referred to is the low statureand stunted character of so many Alpine plants Undoubtedly there aremarked exceptions such as the tall Gentians but generally speakingit must be admitted that mountain plants are short stemmed and dwarfedthe vegetative part of the plant being often merely represented by awreath of leaves This is also very largely the result of the peculiarconditions of plantlife at high altitudes The bright sunlight by dayand intense cold at night have both a retarding effect on the growthof the stem As regards light the converse result is well seen in thelong lanky shoots of a potato growing in a dark cellar But there isalso another factor of some importance The green leaves of plants areconstantly giving out as watery vapour the fluid which has been absorbedby the roots The decreased atmospheric pressure at high altitudes thegeneral dryness of the air and the bright sunlight by day all unite toaccelerate this process During the day the ground is warmed even toa larger extent than the air and thus the absorption of water by theroots is correspondingly hastened During the night the intense radiationrapidly cools down the soil on which the plant grows but the surroundingair is not cooled to anything like the same extent The result is thatthe absorption of fluid by the roots is diminished in a much largerdegree than the effusion of watery vapour from the leaves and the plantis in imminent danger of being dried up To this danger the plants ofhigh altitudes respond in various ways In the first place their stuntedcharacter not only diminishes the area of leaf surface for the exhalationof watery vapour and protects them to some extent from strong winds butit also places them in the lowest stratum of air which is most likelyto assume the temperature of the soil The felted cushionlike habitPlate 9 of so many Alpine plants and the rosettelike arrangementof their leaves Plate 19 are also of advantage to the plants byexposing less leaf surface directly to the air The succulent leaves ofplants like the houseleeks Plates 18 and 19 and the hairy coveringof the Catsfoot Plate 23 Edelweiss and others seem also designedto counteract the tendency to too rapid desiccation and the toughleathery character of many leaves Plate 7 and the thickened cuticle ofothers Plate 30 are clearly of like value The relatively increasedthickness of the leaves of many Alpine plants is also no doubt due tothe intensity of the sunlight for direct experiments have shown thatincreased illumination has this effect Their usual dark green colour isthought to result from an excess of the green pigment by which plantsare able to extract the carbon required for their growth from the airThe rarefaction of the air and shortness of the season of growth at highaltitudes as well as the low stature of most Alpine plants make itessential that assimilation should take place as rapidly as possible whenconditions are favourable for itBut it is in connection with their flowers that the wonderful adaptationof Alpine plants to their surroundings is perhaps best seen The plantsof high altitudes generally bear more numerous and more brightly colouredflowers than do their relatives of the plains The low stature of theplants that bear them gives rise to the impression that the flowers ofthe Alps are also larger than those of lowland districts but thoughundoubtedly more numerous and more crowded together they are of about thesame size as those of other nearly related species The colours of theflowers are however undoubtedly deeper and more intense If we examinespecimens of the same kind of flower for instance the Forgetmenot orEyebright that have been found growing at different altitudes we shallbe struck with the deeper tints of the flowers from the higher regionsThat this character has something to do with the conditions of life inAlpine districts is shown by the disappointment that we sometimes feelat the diminished brilliancy of the flowers of Alpine plants when grownin our gardens at home The flowers of the Alps are also as a rule ofa more highly organised type than those of the plains and correspondingwith this increase in complexity is a relative increase in the number ofpink and blue flowers and a diminution in that of the yellow and whiteAlpine plants too seem to produce more honey than do the correspondingplants in the plains at any rate the yield of honey from beehives isgreater and Bonnier has shown that the secretion of honey by flowers ofthe same kind increases with the altitude and that in some cases thereis a corresponding increase in the intensity of the scent of the flowerWhile many of the characteristics of Alpine flowers are to be explainedas a direct result of the conditions of life at high altitudes it isprobable that the process of natural selection has also had a gooddeal to do with their production One of the principal objects of thelife of a flowering plant is to produce seeds It has been shown thatgenerally speaking more numerous and healthier seeds are produced whenthe seedproducing apparatus of a flower is fertilised by pollen fromthe stamens of a flower of a different plant Hence arrangements haveto be made by plants for the conveyance of their pollen from flowerto flower This is sometimes effected by the wind but much pollen islost so that this is manifestly a very wasteful method Plants havetherefore adopted the more economical plan of getting insect visitors todo this carrying business for them The bright colours and sweet scentsare to attract insects to the flower and honey is provided for theirentertainment there It is generally believed that the total number ofinsect visitors in the Alps is less than in the plains and therefore thecompetition for their services being more severe greater attractions inthe form of brighter coloured flowers and more abundant honey have tobe provided for them But unfortunately the direct observations of HMller do not confirm this view There can be no question however thatthe relative proportion of the several varieties of insects in the Alpsis very different from that in the plains There are comparatively fewflies bees and wasps but numerous humblebees butterflies and mothsin the mountain regions These insects have longer tongues and prefer tovisit flowers of a more complicated structure where the honey cannotbe reached by their shorter tongued relatives Flowers of this sortwith less easily obtained honey are more often of a red or blue or pinkcolour and more rarely of a yellow tint Not a few Alpine flowers likethe Aconites Plates 3 and 4 are entirely dependent on humblebees fortheir fertilisation and an even larger number such as the LongSpurredPansy Plate 5 and several of the Gentians are exclusively visited bybutterflies and moths Mller even goes so far as to suggest that not afew of the Alpine flowers especially those of a pale crimson colour andwith a clovelike smell such as the Pinks Plate 9 have been evolvedin the Alps under the influence of butterflies and moths In spite ofthis it is curious to note that the number of flowers that are habituallyselffertilised is greater in the Alps than in the plains But when itis explained that these are for the most part of the same type of flowerthat is pollinated by flies bees and wasps in lowland districts theapparent anomaly becomes clearThe question of the origin of the Alpine flora is a subject upon whichbotanists are by no means completely agreed at the present time A largenumber of the thousand different plants that are found in the high Alpsreappear in distant mountains and the Arctic regions though absent inthe intervening country Thus the late John Ball calculated that 17 percent of the Alpine species were met with in the Arctic regions and 25per cent in the Altai Mountains of Northern Asia That this is not dueto the conveyance of seeds from place to place by the agency of windor birds is shown by the fact that the resemblance of the plants ofdifferent mountain chains to one another is in no way proportional totheir geographical proximity even when their climate is similar Thetrue explanation is probably to be sought in the Glacial Period in whichthe greater part of Europe was covered by ice so that the climate ofthe plains was very similar to that of the high Alps and Arctic regionsat the present time At this period the flora of the extreme north wasable to mingle with that of the mountain regions When the climate of theintervening districts became once more less severe the competition withthe present lowland flora became so keen that the AlpineArctic plantsretreated to high altitudes or the far north It may be that the highmountain regions have formed centres for the evolution of new species asMr John Ball believed but there is but little direct evidence for thisviewNearly every visitor to Switzerland who regards its rich flora in anyway worthy of notice is desirous to obtain some permanent record of thepleasing impressions obtained Either the flowers are pressed or theplants are pulled up with more or less of their roots to be planted insome garden at home or as the author would suggest is by far the bestmethod photographs of the plants are taken May we here first of allprotest against the wholesale destruction of Alpine plants that goes onevery year by careless visitors Where a few flowers are required forstudy or to be preserved by pressing they may by all means be pickedThere seems no reason also why a few of the more common or abundantplants should not be dug up with their roots carefully packed and takenhome although the Swiss authorities do not permit even this but it isdisgraceful that large nosegays of choice flowers should be gatheredfor the mere pleasure of watching them wither in the hand and thenthrown away The Swiss natives unhappily set us a very bad examplein this respect but it is fortunate that the Edelweiss and Alpenroseare the only flowers that they at all extensively attack Many of themore frequented tourist routes have become almost bare of any but thecommonest flowers One has only to ascend to some peak or glacier by twopaths one that is welltrodden and a second but little used to see howcomplete this destruction of wild flowers has beenExcellent little presses for preserving plants and flowers can be boughtin Switzerland They take up no more room in ones bag than a Baedekeror Bradshaws Guide and do the work much more efficiently Their onlydisadvantage is that they are generally too small to display any butthe tiniest plants completely and it is really wiser to take out fromEngland a couple of boards with straps and a good supply of blottingpaper The special paper sold for pressing plants is much to be preferredto ordinary white or pink blottingpaper as the plants tend to stick toit much less A fair amount will be required as the plants need frequentchanging and the paper must be dried Specimens should be carefully setout by pressing on them with the finger till they take up the requiredpositions and stored when dry in some exercise book or between sheets ofpaperThe cultivation of Alpine plants in our gardens at home is by no meansas easy as might at first be supposed The climate and conditions oflife in Peckham are very different to those at the summit of Pilatusand unless the thing is done carefully and thoroughly it had better notbe attempted at all The chief difficulty in growing Alpine plants inour climate is not the cold but the excessive moisture of winter whichtends to rot their roots and from which they are protected in theirnative home by their snowy covering Our object should be to reproduceas far as possible in our gardens the conditions under which the plantsgrow in the high Alps For the rockery a porous stone will be requiredsuch as limestone or sandstone and it is essential to select a kindthat does not crumble with the frost The partially fused masses ofbrick which can be obtained very cheaply as a waste product from brickkilns when washed over with a mixture of cement and sand do very wellThe rocks and stones must be so laid that every bed or pocket in whichthe plants are to grow is thoroughly well drained for nothing is sodestructive to them as waterlogging of the soil Plants that grow inthe clefts of rocks should be planted in a sloping position as water isthen less liable to collect in the rosettes of leaves Those that growin cool moist spongy soil are best planted in a mixture of peat mossand earth It is also important to notice whether the plant which isbeing cultivated was previously growing on limestone or granitic soilfor it is easy to add a little chalk to the earth if this is required Inplanting out one has to be careful not to curl up the roots and it iswise to sprinkle the plant with water two or three times a day for thefirst week or so Alpine plants should never be manured It should beremembered that mountain plants grow slowly and though very many speciescan be successfully cultivated the Houseleeks and Saxifrages are likelyto give the best results with a minimum of troubleIt is impossible in such a book as this to give more than a few generalsuggestions as to the photography of Alpine plants One of the chiefdifficulties with which one has to contend is the wind When the plant isphotographed anywhere near its natural size the smallest stop has to beused to obtain depth of focus and this greatly increases the durationof the exposure Many of the colour photographs herein reproduced weregiven as long as five or ten minutes When the wind is intermittent itis quite safe to give repeated exposures of a few seconds at a timebeing careful in removing and replacing the cap not to shake the camerafor the plant is sure to return to exactly the same position after beingblown to and fro by the wind Where tall plants are being taken it iswisest to select a time in the early morning or near sunset for thoughthe intensity of light is diminished at these times there is usually butlittle wind The writer has found a strip of white calico some 12 or 15inches wide with long knitting needles sewn on to it at intervals ofgreat value as a wind screen in plant photography The knitting needlescan be pushed into the ground and the plant surrounded on three sides orcompletely by such a screen and thus very largely shaded from the windWith a little care the screen does not appear in the photograph and itis easily rolled up and carried from place to place For near objectsthe intensity of light in the Alps is only slightly greater than that inEngland at the same time of day but it is always wiser to make use of anexposure meter if the best results are desired By the use of the swingback any plane surface whatever be its inclination to the vertical canbe easily focussed This will be found of especial value where a blurredbackground is desired and the slight distortion thus obtained which isso noticeable in architectural subjects is quite negligible in the caseof plant portraits The deep shadows that are produced when flowers arephotographed in bright sunlight are generally best avoidedSUMMER FLOWERS OF THE HIGH ALPS    HERE FOLLOW COLOURED PLATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF 39 SWISS    PLANTS WITH THEIR NAMES IN LATIN ENGLISH FRENCH AND GERMANThe NarcissusFlowered AnemoneANEMONE

survive frequently respond by a process of cooperation and form densecushionlike masses In the high Alps many examples of this are seen Theindividual plants are closely huddled together in the form of a tuft notonly on account of warmth and natural protection and to prevent theirbeing blown away by rough winds but also because the cushion acts as asort of reservoir or sponge and prevents the little plants being dried upby the fierce rays of the sunThe Moss Campion is a typical Cushion plant It is found abundantlyall over the Alps especially in the limestone regions between 5000 and10000 feet or even higher It grows in open rocky places often on thebare rock itself and in the neighbourhood of glaciers and may be foundclose up to the snowline The bright green mosslike cushions formed ofthe

origin in the Steppes of Northern Asia It should be veryeasily recognised The drooping habit of the flowers and the constrictedseedpods are most characteristicThe flowers of this species have generally more red in them than those ofthe specimen photographedIllustration PLATE XIVHEDYSARUM OBSCURUM LThe DullFlowered Sweet Clover or Alpine Sainfoin Esparcette des AlpesDunkler SsskleeThe White DryasDRYAS OCTOPETALAThe White Dryas or Silverherb as the Swiss call it is a characteristicAlpine plant which is found all over Switzerland between 3000 and 8000feet and even descends to the plains with some of the rivers It iscommon in dry mountain pastures and rocky places and seems to grow beston limestone soil Often the bare surfaces of rocks and boulders arethickly covered with its matted growth which persists from year to yearas soil gradually accumulates around itThe thick dense rootstock gives rise to long trailing branches whichextend in all directions and bear the leaves and flowers Associatedwith the root tips is a curious fungus growth which from its constantpresence is thought to be of value to the plant The tough leatheryevergreen leaves have rolled back notched edges Their upper surfaces aredark green smooth and polished and devoid of the stomata or littlepores by which air is absorbed by green plants generally the lowersurfaces are covered by thick white feltlike hairs The flowers whichappear from May till July resemble those of the Alpine Anemone but aresmaller They have usually eight petals hence the Latin name Insidethe petals are a large number of stamens arranged in the form of a ringand inside these again a honey secreting gland which surrounds the massof closely packed carpels in the centre of the flower The carpels bearlong silky styles which grow out into beautiful feathery appendagesas the seeds ripenanother point of resemblance to the Alpine AnemoneThe carpels become ready for pollination before the stamens shed theirpollen Then the outermost stamens open and only after several days haveelapsed do the innermost stamens become mature A little considerationwill show how wonderfully this arrangement is adapted to favour thecrossfertilisation of the carpels by pollen brought from anotherflower by the agency of insect visitors Should this for any reasonfail selffertilisation will almost certainly be effected by means ofthe pollen from the innermost stamens If a large number of plants ofthe White Dryas be carefully examined some will be found with flowerscontaining both stamens and carpels as above described while othersless numerous have flowers with stamens only These will of courseproduce no seeds Some plants again will be seen to bear both kind offlowers The White Dryas is found in the mountainous districts of Europeand in the Arctic regions of the new and old worlds The plant will bereadily recognised for its leaves are quite different from those of ananemoneIllustration PLATE XVDRYAS OCTOPETALA LThe

Alpenrose so much belovedby the Swiss is really a rhododendron and quite a different plant TheAlpine Rose is a shrub sometimes 8 or 10 feet high and only a singlebranch is shown in the photograph It is found on the borders of mountainwoods and in bushy places from the lower slopes up to about 7000 feetand flowers in May June and July The leaves consist of seven toeleven leaflets and there are broad stipules at the base of each leafThe sweetscented flowers are of a rich rosered colour The sepals areexceptionally long and project beyond the petals this is especiallynoticeable in the bud The fruit or hip is flaskshaped and rathernarrowed at the base Thorns are as a rule absent from the floweringbranches but are generally to be found on the lower and younger shootswhich point downwards Sometimes they are absent altogether The AlpineRose is found pretty abundantly in the mountain woods of Southern andCentral Europe but does not extend to the North Thus it grows in thePyrenees Auvergne the Balkans and in one part of the Black ForestThe DogRoses are phenomenally difficult to distinguish from one anotherand as many as fifty Swiss species are described The characteristicsabove mentioned and especially the high elevation at which it is foundwill assist in the recognition of the present species By the arrangementand character of the leaves and spines and the shape of the fruit theAlpine Rose itself has been subdivided into some thirty subspeciesIllustration PLATE XVIROSA ALPINA LThe Alpine Rose Eglantine des Alpes AlpenHeckenroseFleischers WillowHerbEPILOBIUM

towards the plainsLike not a few of the less common Alpine plants where it is found atall it is usually met with in great abundance The flowers which openout in July are of great beauty and their arrangements to preventselfpollination are of considerable interest The stamens first ripenand while these are held erect the stigma is bent downward and the foursegments into which it is divided

serveas storehouses for water The plants grow slowly and in clusters andwhen each one has accumulated sufficient strength it throws up a longcentral stalk bearing starlike flowers and dies as the seeds matureThe houseleeks are reproduced not only by means of seeds but also byrunners which extend outward and bear a small rosette of leaves at theirextremities Some of these can be made out in the photograph Some of theSaxifrages closely resemble the houseleeks in habit of growth but areless succulentThe Mountain Houseleek is common all over the Alps between 4000 and8000 feet or even higher in

PLATE XXIIASTER ALPINUS LThe Alpine Aster or Alpine Starwort Aster des Alpes AlpenAsterThe CatsFoot Mountain Everlasting or Mountain CudweedANTENNARIA DIOICAThe Catsfoot which is after all perhaps the most suitable name forthis curious plant is abundant in the Alps from the lowest levels rightup to 7000 or 8000 feet It is found in dry places on moors and heathsand in dry open woods It sometimes forms an unwishedfor inhabitant ofthe mountain pastures where it is disliked by the herdsmen for it is anundesirable plant for fodder The leaves like those of the Edelweissare covered with white woolly hairs and the flower stems are also hairyThe flowers which are pink or white are dioicious that is to say thesame flower does not produce both pollen and seed and seedforming andpollenproducing flowers do not occur on the same plant As the pollenis not carried by the wind from flower to flower the plant is entirelydependent upon its insect visitors for the fertilisation of its seedsand without them no seeds will be formed The plant is also spread bymeans of runners which extend over the soil and take root at intervalsThe Swiss peasants make wreaths of the Mountain Everlasting whichthey wear as a charm especially on Ascension Day The plant is widelydistributed and is found in the North of England and Scotland as wellas most parts of Europe and the Polar regionsThe

MONTANAA bright conspicuous plant is the Arnica with its yellow starlikeflowerheads It grows in meadows pastures and on sunny moors and iswidely distributed in the Alps from the lower mountain regions up to8000 feet It is much less common in limestone than in other districtsFour broad green leaves grow from the root in the form of a cross Inthe centre of these rises the erect flowerstalk some 8 or 9 incheslong and covered with glandular hairs On the flowerstalk are bornethe one or two pairs of leaves without stalks and arranged oppositeto one another The flowerheads are drooping in the bud but when theyopen they are large and conspicuous and of a deep yellow colour Theygive forth a faint resinous not very pleasing odour The outer or rayflorets of the flowerhead have long projecting strapshaped petalsTheir purpose is to attract insects to the floral society and the lessconspicuous florets in the centre of the flowerhead produce just as goodseeds At first but a single flowerhead is formed but later on if theplant is vigorous buds appear in the axils of the opposite stemleavesand two more flowerheads appear This is what has happened in the twospecimens here photographed and a second pair of buds is seen in oneof them It is interesting to note that a mouldlike fungus is foundconstantly associated with the roots of the plant It is believed thatthe two plants grow together to the mutual advantage of each the fungusassisting the Arnica to obtain nourishment from the soil and in returnreceiving from it some of the organic matter manufactured from the airwith the help of light The root has a bitter aromatic taste From itis made the tincture of Arnica which is often applied to bruisesapparently however without any very considerable influence upon themSeveral other Alpine plants the Doronicum and Aronics for example havebright yellow flowerheads like the Arnica but as no similar Alpineplant has pairs of opposite leaves on the flowerstem the recognition ofthe Arnica becomes a very simple matterIllustration PLATE XXIVARNICA MONTANA LThe Arnica Arnica Echtes WohlverleiThe Spiny Fullers ThistleCIRCIUM SPINOSISSIMUMSee FrontispieceThis stately and beautiful plant is common in all parts of the Alpsbut is found nowhere else It grows in moist places in the meadows andpastures and beside the streams between 4000 and 7000 feet It isgenerally looked upon as a noxious weed by the herdsmen but in one ortwo places the upper and more succulent parts are gathered and preservedas pigs food for the winterThe thick evergreen leaves armed with formidable spines are palerat the upper part of the stem where they surround the large brownflowerhead Usually but a single flowerhead is borne by each plantbut each one produces some hundreds of seeds Each seed has a featherywinglike appendage so that it may be more easily distributed by thewind The Spiny Fullers Thistle is usually some 3 or 4 feet high aswas the specimen photographed but in high altitudes the plant is morebushy and stunted Under these conditions it is not unlike the Stemlessor Alpine Carline Thistle Carlina acaulis which in spite of itsname has sometimes a stem some 8 or 10 inches long But the CarlineThistle has a larger and more flattened flowerhead and when the flowersare in bloom they are of a purple colour though they soon turn brown asthey get dried upProbably the nearest relation of the plant here photographed is theCommon Fullers Thistle Circium oloraceum abundant in moist placesboth in the Alps and lowlands It is a plant that would seem to beprotected by its resemblance to other members of its family for thoughit appears spiny it is soft and succulent and bears not a singleprickle anywhere The leaves which are sparsely distributed on theslender stem are of a dirty greygreen colour and though as tall as itsspiny relative the plant is much less robustThe RoundHeaded RampionPHYTEUMA ORBICULAREIn England we have only two kinds of Rampion and both are rare but inSwitzerland there are no less than ten different species with blueand white flowers and some of them are extremely abundant One ofthe commonest of the blueflowered varieties is here photographed Itgrows in mountain pastures and poor meadows between 3000 and 8000 feetand is found not only in the Alps but all over Central Europe thoughabsent in the North It flowers in July and the size of the plantundergoes considerable variation according to the altitude at which itgrows Sometimes the flowerstalks are but 3 or 4 inches long at others16 or 18 The leaves which grow from the root stock have serratededges and are frequently a good deal larger than those of the specimenphotographed The methods adopted by the plant for the distributionof its pollen and the fertilisation of its seeds through the agencyof insect visitors are of particular interest Each flower of theflowerhead is formed of a blue tubular structure corolla which is atfirst closed above In the centre of this is the style covered by shorthairs and surrounded by the five stamens While still in the bud thestamens shed their pollen which collects in the tube around the styleand is retained in position by the short hairs Now the flower opensat its tip and while maintaining its tubular character above splitslongitudinally below into five or six segments so that linear openingsare formed The result is that when an insect settles on the flower thetubular corolla is very easily depressed exposing the style surroundedon all sides by pollen Any pollen that is not removed by the insectfalls from the style for the short hairs on the style by which it isheld in position very soon fade The style then splits above into threesegments exposing for the first time the sticky stigmatic surface nowready for pollinationThe Roundheaded Rampion is one of the five Swiss species with roundednot elongated flowerheads Three of them can at once be put asidebecause they are usually much smaller plants and have less than twelveflowers to a flowerhead whereas the Roundheaded Rampion has alwaysmore Phyteuma Scheuchzeri is distinguished from this plant by itslilac flowers longer stalked and usually broader

cultivated in rockeries in England thehairy character of the plant almost entirely disappears Some three tofive pendent flowers are borne by each flowerstalk all turned in thesame direction Occasionally a single flowered variety is met withusually at a high altitude The ordinary pale blue colour of the flowermay disappear entirely and specimens with pure white blossoms are notinfrequent The plant is found abundantly all over the Alps and SubAlpsin meadows and pastures and to a less extent in open woods from 3000feet almost to the snowline 7000 to 9000 feet It is usually lessabundant on limestone than on other rocks The Bearded Bellflower isalso met with in the Carpathians Jura southern parts of Norway and inother mountainous districts in Europe It is probably a native of theAlpsNo difficulty will be experienced in recognising the Bearded CampanulaNo other Bellflower has little projections between each of the fiveteeth of the calyx which are turned back towards the stem Only oneother Bellflower Campanula Zoysii and that a species not alwaysrecognised as distinct has a light blue corolla with long hairs aroundits mouth But here there is a constriction just immediately below theopening of the bell and the plant is smaller and very rare and occursonly in Eastern SwitzerlandIllustration PLATE XXVICAMPANULA BARBATA LThe Bearded Bellflower or Campanula

descends with some of the rivers towardsthe plains It is also found in the Jura and parts of the Black ForestThe Dwarf Bellflower will be recognised from most of the other speciesof Campanula which abound in Switzerland by its broad basal leaves itsnarrow stem leaves and its erect seed pod But unfortunately thereare three other Swiss species to which this description equally wellapplies Of these the rare Campanula excisa is at once picked out bythe deep rounded clefts between the five segments of its bellshapedflower Campanula Scheuchzeri is a larger plant of more open and lesstufted growth and with fewer flowerless leafy shoots Its bellshapedflowers are usually of a darker blue are more conical and have awider opening they are in fact less truly bellshaped Campanularotundifolia the common Hairbell of our heaths and downs which occursalso in Switzerland is slightly taller than our plant and has also moreconeshaped flowers Its flower buds are held erect while those of theother three Bellflowers we are considering are dependent In a generalway the low stature and tufted growth of the Dwarf Bellflower will inmost cases suffice for its recognitionIllustration PLATE

known of all the Alpine plantsIt abounds almost everywhere were it not so it would have becomepractically extinct years before for it is gathered unmercifully Norare the visitors to Switzerland alone responsible for this Every Sundaythroughout the summer crowds of the native peasants both children andadults may be seen returning home each bearing in his arms an immensebunch of the favourite flower and often with a second and smallernosegay tied round the top of his alpenstockThere are really two distinct species of Alpenrose the HairyleavedRhododendron hirsutum and the Rustyleaved Rhododendronferrugineum varieties and a hybrid or cross between them is alsoless commonly found Both varieties are low evergreen shrubs with thickleathery leaves which only fade after three or four years Both haveraised brown spots on the lower surfaces of the leaves only they aremuch more numerous on the Rustyleaved species so that the under surfaceof the leaf is completely covered with them while they are only sparselyscattered on the leaf of the Hairyleaved variety They contain a balsamand are thought to be of use to the plant in preventing its drying upThey may also assist in the absorption of water The flowers of bothspecies are admirably adapted for crossfertilisation by the humblebeeswhich visit them The stamens first mature and not until the greatpart of the pollen is shed does the stigma lengthen and become readyfor pollination The long hairs growing from the stalks which bear thestamens interlock with similar hairs on the inside of the corolla andthus effectively prevent the entrance of smaller insects which mightvisit the flower in search of the abundant honey but which would failto effect its fertilisation The flowers of the species here illustratedare usually a little paler in colour slightly smaller and open alittle later than those of the Rustyleaved variety The plant usuallyforms a lower and more thickly branched shrub with rather shortertwigs But the essential distinguishing features between the two areto be found in their leaves The leaves of Rhododendron hirsutum areusually broader and less pointed green underneath and have wellmarkedhairs all round their edges In Rhododendron ferrugineum the leavestend to be narrower darker green above and brown underneath and areentirely devoid of hairs but have rolled back edges Both species arefound abundantly in rocky places between 4000 and 8000 feet and flowerin June July and August and may be seen at their best in July TheRustyleaved variety seems to prefer a rather moister

coloured corolla shrivelsup and surrounds the seed vessel at the same time becoming of a greencolour and perhaps taking on a vegetative function The leaves are ratherleathery narrow and pointedIt is often quite a difficult matter to distinguish between the StemlessGentian here illustrated and the Carved Gentian Gentiana excisanot only because the two plants are so much alike but also becauseintermediate forms exist indeed it is open to question whether thetwo plants are really to be regarded as distinct species In the CarvedGentian the calyx lobes become contracted just above their bases towiden out again above and the recesses between the lobes are morerounded and less pointed The leaves also are broader less leathery andnot nearly so sharp pointed as those of the socalled stemless varietyThe flowers of the Marsh Gentian Gentiana Pneumonanthe are also notunlike those of the plant here photographed but it should be readilydistinguished because its leaves are

distinguish between them is not easy Of these theBavarian Gentian Gentiana bavarica is recognised from our plant byits longer stem perhaps 2 to 3 inches long on which only two or threepairs of opposite leaves are borne and by the fact that the lower leavesare smaller than the upper The Spring Gentian Gentiana verna has avery short stem covered by closely packed leaves like the

more characteristic featuresIllustration PLATE XXXIILINARIA ALPINA MILLThe Alpine Toadflax Linaire des Alpes AlpenLeinkrautThe Alpine BalsamERINUS ALPINUSThe Alpine Balsam is a characteristic rock plant of the limestone AlpsTaking root in the clefts of the rocks it sends out radiating branchesin all directions which adhere closely to the surface It may also besought in dry mountain meadows and among the grass of dry stony slopesand is fairly common between 4000 and 7000 feet Sometimes it is metwith at a lower altitude in rocky places The leaves which are broaderat their free extremities and covered by short hairs are crowdedtogether at the base of the stem They have deeply serrated edgesThe violetpurple or occasionally white flowers which are formed offive petals united at their bases are borne at the extremities of thebranches The Alpine Balsam is found not only in the Swiss Alps but alsoin the Tyrol the Jura the Vosges and Pyrenees It flowers from earlyJune till AugustThe flowers of the Birdseye or Mealy Primrose Primula farinosa arenot unlike those of the Alpine Balsam at any rate at first sight Buteach Mealy Primrose plant bears but a single leafless flowerstem whichterminates in a cluster of flowers Moreover the Mealy Primrose is foundin moist meadows and boggy places and rarely among rocks and its leaveshave a grey powdery bloom on their lower surfacesIllustration PLATE XXXIIIERINUS ALPINUS LThe Alpine Balsam Erine des Alpes AlpenLeberbalsamThe Leafy LousewortPEDICULARIS FOLIOSAThe Louseworts as a whole have been exceedingly successful in the AlpsNo less than fourteen different species are to be found and some ofthem are exceedingly common In spite of their unpleasant name theyare for the most part really beautiful plants and as a group they areinteresting in several ways In the first place they are all in somedegree parasites on other plants Branches arise from the roots whichattach themselves to the roots of neighbouring plants and absorb fromthem water or salts or even organic nourishment The Leafy Lousewortis not a great offender in this respect but other species are capableof completely destroying many of the surrounding plants The method ofpollination of the Lousewort flowers is also somewhat remarkable Theflowers are only visited by humble bees for no other insect appears tobe strong enough to force an entrance into the flower As may be made outfrom the photograph the flower consists of two lips In the upper is avertical slit through which the stigma alone projects but immediatelybehind the slit are the four stamens The lower lip forms practically alanding stage for insect visitors When the humblebee alights on theflower his head is sure to come in contact with the projecting stigmaand some of the pollen which he unconsciously carries with him will beremoved As he bends forward and thrusts his head into the flower tosuck the honey the vertical slit in the upper lip will be widened outand the stamens will protrude and strike the insects head When thehumblebee at last leaves the flower to continue his journey its variousparts will resume their former relative positions Should no insectsvisit the flower selfpollination will occur This appears to be theusual course of events in the North where humblebees are scarce InSpitzbergen where there are no humblebees a nearlyrelated speciesPedicularis lanata is said to be regularly selffertilised withoutapparently suffering in any possible wayThe Leafy Lousewort here illustrated is the commonest variety in mostdistricts It is a tall stately plant often some two feet high whichis found on grassy slopes and in rocky places between 3500 and 7000 feetand grows best on a limestone soil The large finedivided leaves areeven found among the pale yellow flowers on the flowerstem The plantflowers in June and July and is found in the Alps Pyrenees Vosges andJura It will be readily recognised by its alternate leaves and paleyellow hairy flowers without any beaklike projection at their summitsPedicularis Oederi which is a little like it has no foliage leavesbetween the flowers which are devoid of hairs and have a blackish redspot on either side of the upper lipIllustration PLATE XXXIVPEDICULARIS FOLIOSA LThe Leafy Lousewort Pdiculaire  pi feuill ReichbeblttertesLusekrautThe Yellow AuriculaPRIMULA AURICULADirectly the snow melts up come the Auriculas but only on limestonesoil The Auricula is really a spring plant and usually flowers inMay but where protected by slowly melting masses of snow it may notbloom till much later the accompanying photograph was taken in JulyThe thick dense rootstock penetrates deep into the clefts of the rockThe leaves are smooth rather fleshy and of a bluishgreen colour Theupper surface of the leaves the flowerstalk and the calyx are coveredwith a white mealy substance The leaves appear to serve the plant as ameans of absorbing or storing water Although the thick dense cuticleusually present on leaves which have this function is here absent theyare found to dry up very slowly It is probable that the thick cellulosewalls between the individual cells replace the cuticle in the leaves ofthis plant The flowers give forth a pleasant odour something like thatof the cowslip but rather sweeter Like the flowers of the primrosethey are of two kinds The one has a long stigma which projects as faras the opening of the flower and short stamens and the converse is thecase in the other The object of this arrangement is to facilitate thepollination of the flowers by the agency of insect visitors as they passfrom the one type to the other Darwin found that very few seeds wereformed when the flowers were selffertilisedThe Auricula grows in rocky places between 3000 and 7000 feet It is onlyfound in limestone districts and is rather local It is also to be metwith in the Jura Dauphiny the Pyrenees the Carpathians and in one ortwo places in the Black ForestThe Auricula will be readily recognised From the Oxlip Primulaelatior and Cowslip Primula officinalis or veris it isdistinguished by its smooth not wrinkled leaves and mealy stem It isprobable that most of the brilliantly coloured garden Auriculas wereoriginally derived from this speciesIllustration PLATE XXXVPRIMULA AURICULA LThe Yellow Auricula Primevre Auricule FelsenAurikel oderFlhblemliThe Marsh OrchisORCHIS LATIFOLIAA large number of Orchids are to be found in the Alps They form awelldefined group of plants which are particularly interesting inview of complicated devices which they have adopted to ensure thefertilisation of their seeds by the agency of insect visitors Nearly allthe English species are found in Switzerland and most of them are metwith in much greater abundance there The beautiful pink Helleborine thesweetscented Butterfly Orchis may be found in profusion on the lowermountain slopes and the dark red Nigritella with its odour of vanillaand the ghostlike Coralroot in the higher regionsOf the genus Orchis alone there are no less than seventeen Swiss speciesMany of these are much alike and by no means easy to distinguish fromone another One of the most abundant is the Marsh Orchis which is alsomet with in England but is not nearly so common there The plant growsin damp meadows and boggy places where an average sized plant may be 18inches or two feet high Its large purple spotted flowers appear in Juneand may last until JulyThe methods adopted by the plant to ensure the fertilisation of itsflowers by means of insect visitors are most elaborate and exact butwithout the aid of diagrams they are a little difficult to explain It iscurious that no honey is contained in the spur It is probably the cellsap in it that is attractive to insectsThe Marsh Orchis will be recognised by its spreading spotted leaveshollow stem the palmshaped tubers of its root and the thick spur tothe flowerIllustration PLATE XXXVIORCHIS LATIFOLIA LThe Marsh Orchis LOrchis  Feuilles Larges BreitblttrigesKnabenkrautThe Ladys SlipperCYPRIPEDIUM CALCEOLUSThis is one of the most striking plants of the Swiss flora and whilenowhere common is pretty widely distributed in the limestone districts ofthe Alps It is a plant of some size perhaps 12 to 24 inches in heightand grows in stony woods from the lower mountain region up to 6500 feetOne to three large yellow flowers are borne by each plant Their methodof fertilisation is of exceptional interest Close to the attachment ofthe yellow slippershaped petal to the rest of the flower is a projectionbearing on each side a stigmatic surface below and a mass of pollenabove The large yellow petal is smooth inside and has overhanging edgesrather like those of the familiar beetletrap that is used for catchingcockroaches and as we shall see in a moment it acts in a similar mannerThere is no honey in the flower and it is not quite clear what the smallbees that have been seen visiting it go there for But at any rate whenthey once get in they have the greatest possible difficulty in gettingout again and only succeed in doing so by climbing up the attached sideof the flower where the edges are not overhanging that is on either sideof the central projection In doing this they are sure to brush firstagainst the stigmatic surface leaving behind some of the pollen they maychance to have sticking to them and then against the viscid mass ofpollen some of which is sure to become attached to them This processhas been actually observed by Dr Herman Mller in the AlpsThe Ladys Slipper Orchid is found also in the Jura Tyrol DauphinyPyrenees in certain parts of Central and Southern Germany and even inthe North of England It is everywhere rather rare but specially soin this country It flowers in May and June and is sure to be easilyrecognised for there is no other plant in the least like itNo doubt such names as the Ladys Slipper Ladys Mantle andLadysTresses refer to the dedication of the plant to the Virgin inmedival times The French name Sabot de Vnus refers to a verydifferent personage A comparison between the English French Germanand the scientific names for the last of which Linneus is responsibleis a good example of the way in which the goddess Venus and the VirginMary were often confounded with one another in the early daysIllustration PLATE XXXVIICYPRIPEDIUM CALCEOLUS LThe LadysSlipper Orchid Sabot de Vnus Gemeiner FrauenschuhThe White VeratrumVERATRUM ALBUMThe White Veratrum is a tall weed with large green leaves very abundantin moist meadows and pastures in all parts of the Alps between 2000 and6000 feet Before the flowers appear it strongly suggests one of thelarger Gentians but the flowers which come out in July and Augustare quite different It is a widely distributed plant being found inRussia Siberia Lapland as well as in most of the mountain ranges ofCentral and Southern Europe It appears to have been left as a relic ofthe glacial period in the higher parts of Silesia and the Black ForestThe large green leaves are downy beneath and the flowers which arealways green externally may be pure white var typicum or morecommonly yellowishgreen var Lobelianum internally Some wouldregard these two varieties as distinct species The whole plant isextremely poisonous Sometimes it is eaten by the sheep and goats withdisastrous results to the herdsmen but the cattle are wiser and rarelymake this mistake The poison is an alkaloid Veratrin which is containedin largest quantities in the root from which it is extracted for medicalpurposes If the root be tasted it will at first appear sweet but itsacrid bitter flavour soon overpowers this first impression The Swissherdsmen look upon the White Veratrum as a noxious weed not only becauseof its poisonous properties but also because it grows in the richestsoil and robs the true fodder plants of nourishment In the Jura on theother hand the farmers rather welcome it They say that the shade of itslarge leaves preserves the grass for the cattle and prevents it becomingdried up by the scorching sunThe White Veratrum will be easily recognised Its nearest relative theBlack Veratrum Veratrum nigrum is a much rarer plant that grows inwoods It has reddishblack or chocolate flowers which grow in largespikes like those of the plant here illustrated but each individualflower has a relatively longer flowerstalkIllustration
